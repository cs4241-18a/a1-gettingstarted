    <h3>Self Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Myo Min Thant. I come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar" target="_blank">Myanmar</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Majors and Minor</h3> 
    <p>
      I am currently a Junior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Computer Engineering.

    <h3>More about me!</h3> 
    <p>
      My specific interests in Computer Science are Web Development and Mobile App Development. I am more familiar with

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      For the last summer 2018, I worked at <a href="https://www.bindez.com" target="_blank">Bindez</a> as a Software Developer Intern. Bindez is a company which does 
      Natural Language Processing for Myanmar Language and Social Insights and analysis for other companies.
      I, as a software developer, was responsible with implementing tools for researchers and main products, 
      indexing Myanmar language as we pushed further in natural language processing (new keywords, new trends, confusion matrix), 
      and training dataset and finding anomalies.
