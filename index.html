      Hi! I'm a computer science major in the class of 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previous computer science courses I've taken include Object-Oriented Design Concepts, Systems Programming Concepts, Operating Systems, Databases, Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, and Software Security Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've had some experience creating websites with HTML and CSS, and I'm pretty comfortable programming in Java, C, C# and Python. I'm also familiar with unit testing. However, I don't have too much experience with JavaScript or Ruby.
