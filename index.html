    <h1>Information about Eoin O'Connell</h1>
    <p>
      I am in my final year at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and I'm definitely interested in genetics, DNA regulation, and biovisualization.
      I'm a pianist for fun, and I enjoy learning about history maybe a little too much. I see myself working with genetic data and statistics 
      visualization in the future.

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I have had two coops in bioinformatics related fields, both of which utilized Python and

      I have also had experience using MariaDB and MySQL DBMS.
      
      The following is my experience with several technologies and methods:
