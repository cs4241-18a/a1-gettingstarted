      Hi! I'm super excited for this class, as I've always been curious about Web
	  Development. I've dabbled here and there, but I want something I can really
	  sink my teeth into. I can't wait to see what everybody ends up making!

	<h4>
	A little bit about me:
	</h4>
	<p>
	  I loooooove &#9829&#9829&#9829 to read and I used to do it
	  aaallll the time back in middle school. I really took advantage of the fact 
	  that my homeroom teacher would pick up the books in her mailbox I had put on 
	  hold the previous night and place them on my desk. Nowadays I don't read as
	  avidly as I did before, but the occasional book catches my eye. I highly
	  recommend the book <i>Sharp Objects</i>, by Gillian Flynn (author of 
	  <i>Gone Girl</i>). It was recently adapted into an equally good HBO series
	  of the same name that I <i>also</i> highly recommend.
	</p>
	<p>
	I also watch a lot of Youtube. They actually recently released a feature called
	"Time Watched" that you should check out (unless you are dreading the results).
	Mine was...not surprising. Same for my "time listened" for Spotify 2017...
