    <h1>Information about Joan Wong</h1>
    <p>
      I'm in the Class of 2019 at <a href="https://www.wpi.edu">Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)</a>, majoring in Computer Science. To give a brief introduction about myself,   
      I like challenges because I believe that the process of figuring things out is crucial to me learning and improving. That's why you will usually find me sitting somewhere and ponder about a problem.
      To me, being able to solve a problem is very satisfying. I can be very quiet, but I also can be very talkative because I may ask a lot of questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fun Facts About Me:
      <ol>
	      <li>I enjoy daydreaming when I'm alone. That's one of the most relaxing methods I found and is very effective.</li>
	      <li>My hobbies include (but not limited to) swimming, listening to music, watching television, and coding (as what I'm doing right now)...</li>

    <p>
      This past summer I was a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://www.novomaticamericas.com">Novomatic Americas</a>. I was responsible for improving one of the 
      company's current simulator (C++) that runs all of its new game designs for testing, in Visual Studio.
      The new features I added to this simulator included the display of wins on the user-interface (using SDL) and the functionality to run a different type of game than it currently can.
