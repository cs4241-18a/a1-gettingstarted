                  <h3>Bio</h3>
                  <p class="rescue">
                    I'm passionate about Cybersecurity and Data Visualization. I want to combine the two and create new ways to visualize attack vectors and vulnerabilities and develop
                    new tools from the results of these visualizations. Creating a new way to present security data to bridge the technical gap between professional cybersecurity
                    analysts and the clients they are presenting this information to can increase communication and understanding for either party.

          <h3><u>Worldwide Happiness Visualization</u></h3>
          <p>For this project we created a webpage that allows people to interact and see why some countries are happier than others. To complete this task we started collecting readily available country specific metrics that we believed could cause a certain country’s inhabitants to be relatively more or less happy. The data that we gathered was the reported average reported happiness by country, total population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), inflation, unemployment, and alcohol consumption, all of this data was gathered from the year 2008 to 2016. We wanted to present this data in a way that would allow people to engage, and explore the information on their own.
