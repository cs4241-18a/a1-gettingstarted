        Hey, I'm Krysta, graduating class of 2019 at WPI! I grew up in Meriden, CT with two older brothers and a partner in crime (aka my mom). Both of my brothers graduated from WPI, the same
        university where I study now, and have been my inspiration to pursue engineering. Between the houses of my parents and my siblings, we have 8 cats,
        so I guess that means I may be a crazy cat lady in training.
    </p>

        At WPI, I am pursuing a double major in electrical and computer engineering and computer science with a minor in music. In order to complete my degree,
        I am working with a team to develop a modular system to make off-road vehicles autonomous. My role in this project is to use data fusion and processing
        to establish decision making while the vehicle is in motion. Look for project updates, team videos, and more information on
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wpibajamqp/">social media</a>!
    </p>
    <p>
        Aside from engineering, there are many things I am passionate about, the biggest two being music and travel. I have been singing my entire life, and doing so is by far one of the
        best aspects. Recently, I have started exploring other ways to experience music, including competing with the WPI ballroom dance team. My passion to travel,
        is also changing and expanding as I experience more and more cultures and adventures. Just last summer I visited 15 countries, and that is just the beginning!

    <ul>
        <li>
            This past summer, I was a software engineering intern at HYPACK, A Xylem Brand in Middletown, CT. HYPACK is a company that develops and maintains products for
            hydrographic survey, the process of mapping the ocean floor. My primary work with this company focused on designing and implementing filters for topographic
            laser data, specifically LiDAR, which allows the 3D point cloud data to be more efficiently processed and displayed in real-time.

        <li>
            The previous summer, I worked with a small team as an unpaid consultant for the Museum of London Docklands in Canary Wharf, London. Our work focused on
            designing, implementing, and testing STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, mathematics) resources to engage families and school groups in the
            museum’s galleries.
