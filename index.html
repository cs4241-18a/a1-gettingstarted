    <p>
      I'm currently completing my final term at WPI. In my free time I do video game cheat and bot development for a few games. I'm a big dog and bird person. I love any show on netflix that's over 1 season.

    <h2>Technologies and Methods Experience</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>Enough to get things done. I know basic tags. I can list most things you need to get things done but I sometimes have to google which tags correspond to what</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>A little less than html. I usually use bootstrap if I have to do it. For padding and stuff though I have to consult the documents a lot</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>Can work in it perfectly fine I just need to look up any docs for specific frameworks or projects I need to work with</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>I've done work with it. Can do things self sufficiently but need to look at documentation for specific frameworks</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Ruby</h3>
        <p>No Experience</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>No issues working with it, pretty straight forward</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Unit Testing</h3>
        <p>Had to do it for intro cs courses, did it at internship, and do it for personal projects.</p>
