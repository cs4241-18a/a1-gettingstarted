    <h1>Information about Kamil Gumienny</h1>
    <p>
       Hey everyone, it's your favorite person named Kamil Gumienny!
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a WPI junior studying Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Okay first off I just want to say I am blown away that I've taken something on my computer and just uploaded it to my very own internet page that anyone can access. This is actually exciting.

      I'm a junior CS major hoping to get into cyber security.
      Other things about myself:
      -I love any and everything outdoors as long as it's not a sport (I'm athletically challanged), most especially taking my puppy (INSERT PICTURE OF KUBUS HERE) on walks.
      -I enjoy going to the gym. It's my happy place and I need to spend at least 1.5 hours in the gym a day to reset my mojo.
      -I am a brother of Theta Chi and am currently serving as the interim Secretary. Being in a fraternity adds many obligations to my schedule but I find it worth it because all those obligations are fulfilled with people I enjoy being around.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      On campus I worked with the Athletic Department to help facilitate sporting events (the students in the bright green shirts catching foul soccer balls).

      I currently work on-call for a cybersecurity company in Newport Beach, CA. I enjoy this field of work and hope to enter the workforce as a Cybersecurity Analyst. My goal is to be in a Red Team or a Security Software Developer.
