    <h2>Alex the Software Engineering</h2>
    <p class="centertext">
      I am passionate about problem solving! It seems like everyday I find myself asking "How can we fix that?",
      "How can we make that better?", "How can I fix or make that better with CS?". I see myself as a problem
      solver more than a computer scientist. To me, computer science is a tool to solve real problems.
      With that being said, <strong>I love to code</strong>! Courses I've taken WPI include all of the systems courses,
      software engineering, RBE 1002-3001, a couple digital ECE courses, and algorithms. I know a lot of Java.
      I know some Python, HTML, and CSS. I know absolutly no Ruby, JavaScript, or Unit Testing.

    <h2>Alex the Travel Enthusiast</h2>
    <p class="centertext">
      When I am not cleansing the world of segfaults and merge conflicts, I love to spend my time traveling! I
      have been blessed to be able to travel to over 15 countries and experience so many different cultures. For me,
      it's more than just the views and the people. Traveling gives me an opportunity to realize different
      problems that I may not be able to experience in America, and understand how people in different
      cultures approach solving these problems.
