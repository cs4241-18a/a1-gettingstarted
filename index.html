    <h1>Information about [Griffin Cecil]</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Griffin Cecil and I am a senior this year, class of 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a computer science major, as I suspect most are, currently without a minor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some notable classes I've taken so far have been Software Engineering and Database Systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      As far as working experience goes, I've had a lot of experience with Java and unit testing, some experience with
      JavaScript and Python, and no experience with CSS, HTML, or Ruby.
    </p>
