    <h3>More Information about me:</h3>
    <p>
    I was born and raised in Cleveland. My favorite teams are the Cleveland Browns, Indians, Cavaliers, and whatever team Lebron is on. I'm a hard bandwagon fan, sue me. I like long walks on the beach, traveling to foreign countries, and eating food. I'm officially a (volunteer assistant) coach at WPI. Some of my favorite people include Dave Chappelle, Donald Glover, and of course Lebron James. I'm extremely happy to have my first assignment of the term finished.
