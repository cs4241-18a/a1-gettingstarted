      Hi! I am a 2nd Year CS student at WPI. I enjoy talking to just about everybody... you might say that's not really a skill but I can actually talk to anyone. 
      On campus, I am a part of WICS, ACM.
      In my free time I like eating, watching tv, hiking, biking, and laughing at everything.
