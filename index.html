    <h1>Harsh Rana</h1>
    <p>
        Hello World! My name is Harsh and I'm a student at <b>Worcester Polytechnic Institute</b>. I'm passionate about data analytics, visualization and machine learning. Someday, I hope to work in a quant/hedge fund solving complex financial problems using computer science.
        
        Outside of academics, I highly enjoying reading self-help and finacial books. Some of my favorites include <i>The way of the superior man, How to win friends and influence people</i> and most recently, <i>The $100 Startup.</i> I also enjoy rock climbing (I started over the summer of 2018 and am a complete beginner), watching TED talks, running and learning new things.

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
        While I've never had an official software engineering/CS internship, this past year I worked with IPG Photonics and developed a web application and database to store their test data. It was a very good experience and I learnt a lot about the full-stack web development process. <br><br>
        Here's my experience levels with some of the technologies covered in this course:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML: A lot</li>
      <li>CSS: A lot</li>
      <li>Java: A lot</li>
      <li>JavaScript: Some</li>
      <li>Ruby: None</li>
      <li>Python: A lot</li>
      <li>Unit Testing: None</li>                
    </ul>
