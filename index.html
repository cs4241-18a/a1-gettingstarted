    <h1>Information about Griffin Cecil</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Griffin Cecil and I am a senior this year, class of 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a computer science major, as I suspect most are, currently without a minor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some notable classes I've taken so far have been Software Engineering and Database Systems.
