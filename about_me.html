    <blockquote>Success is never owned. It's rented; and the rent is due everyday.</blockquote>

    <p class="centertext">
      I am a senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science
      (CS) with a minor in Robotic Engineering (RBE). WPI has a strong project-based curriculum, meaning, I have
      a lot of experience working with teams of all sizes and on some pretty interesting projects. I am always
      trying to develop and improve myself either by reading books, listening to podcasts or simplifying learning
      from my mistakes. I'm motivated and goal-driven. And I see everyday as an opportunity to pursue my goals.
