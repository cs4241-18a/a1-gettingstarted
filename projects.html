    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <h2>Software Engineering: Course Registration Platform -- 2018</h2>
    <project>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed a web application on a team of 6, to assist instructors at WPI in
          registering for courses to teach.</li>
        <li>Utilized resource gathering techniques to identify the functionality needed
          by the app.</li>
        <li>The app was developed using the Spring framework. Database was created in
          PostgreSQL (pgAdmin IDE). Back-end created in Java (Eclipse IDE). Front-end
          created in Google Web Toolkit.</li>
        <li>I helped create each layer of the application (DB, Back-end, Front-end)
          while also being a project manager for the team.</li>
      </ul>
    </project>

    <h2>Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP) -- 2017-2018</h2>
    <project>
      <ul>
        <li>A 14-week project where my team of 4 collaborated directly with a sponsor
          company, in China, to solve real-world problems they faced. Our team provided
          the sponsor company with several major deliverables, which, were immediately
          integrated into company operations and products.</li>
        <li>Created a 200+ page research document for the company, outlining the current
          state of the industry they work in and making recommendations to improve
          performance of the company.</li>
        <li>My role on the team was that of a project manager.</li>
      </ul>
    </project>

    <h2>Unified Robotics III: 3-DOF Robot Arm -- 2017</h2>
    <project>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed a real-time processor program with a team of 4, to control a 3-DOF
          robot arm to sort specific objects by their weight and color with the use of visual
          tracking and force sensors. </li>
        <li>Focused on embedded computing and dynamic [feedback] response as it relates to
          motion planning.</li>
        <li>Utilized forward and inverse kinematics, forward and inverse velocity kinematics
          and actuator design to develop trajectory planning functions for a 3-DOF arm.</li>
      </ul>
    </project>

    <h2>Unified Robotics II: Flame Extinguishing Robot -- 2016</h2>
    <project>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed an autonomous robot with a team of 4, that navigates a structured environment,
          finds the simulated fire (a candle), reports the location of the simulated fire, and
          finally, extinguishes the flame before returning back to its original starting location.</li>
        <li>To navigate the field, the robot relies on two infrared sensors, in addition to an IMU
          (Inertial Measurement Unit) to determine the heading of the robot in relation to the robot’s
          origin.</li>
      </ul>
    </project>

    <h2>Unified Robotics I: Nuclear Reactor Robot -- 2016</h2>
    <project>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed an autonomous system on a team of 4, that can pick up spent nuclear rods from a
          reactor, store them in a safe area, and refuel the reactor with a fresh rod.</li>
        <li>To navigate the field, the robot relies on a Bluetooth connection. The field relays information
          about the field itself, such as the location of new rods and the availability of storage for used
          rods.</li>
      </ul>
    </project>
