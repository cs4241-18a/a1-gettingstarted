This project shows my ability to deploy a web app with Heroku, and display information about myself in a clean and readable manner.

## Technical Achievements
- **Images**: Modified server.js to send images to the web server. Displayed said images in the header of the webpage to add personal touch. The sizing and formatting of the images was a task I had not yet encountered and forced me to do research into splitting up webpages horizontally as well as vertically.

### Design Achievements
- **Interactive Slider**: With help from www.w3schools.com, added interactive functionality to my webpage through a automatically adjusting slider. When hovering over one of the listed programming languages, the slider automatically slides to a predefined value that demonstrates my proficiency in said language/technology. I had not done this before, and it allowed me to practice writing JavaScript within an HTML file.
