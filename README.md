This project shows a simple website that I created following the content guidelines provided. I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the site.

## Technical Achievements
- **Serving a CSS Stylesheet**: I modified the server.js file to serve up my custom CSS stylesheet to the browser upon request. I accomplished this by adding a "styles.css" case to the pathname switch statment.
- **Disappearing Text**: I used a series of JavaScript functions to display/remove the informational text on my webpage when a button is clicked. There are three buttons, and clicking each will replace the information with the specific content linked to each button. If a button is clicked while its content is displayed, the content will be hidden.

### Design Achievements
- **Column Layout**: The main body of my website is formatted in a two column layout to support the changing text described above. This was accomplished by creating custom div styles in my CSS stylesheet for the columns and using another div to contain both columns.
- **Header and Footer**: I modified the original HTML document so that the top heading of the page was contained in a header section rather than with all of the other text. I also added a footer that is stuck to the bottom of the webpage. The footer contains a link to my github page and an email link.
