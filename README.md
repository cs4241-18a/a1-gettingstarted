## Technical Achievements
- **Modified Server.JS**: Modified Server.js to handle styles.min.css.
- **Minified CSS**: Shrunk the CSS loaded min.css to enhance load speed of the site.
- **Included Bootstrap through CDN**: Imported Bootstrap through CDN for better caching in the browser

### Design Achievements
- **Typing Animation**: Shown in `style.css`, 3 css animations were used using key-frames.
- **Bar Graphs**: Shown in `index.html`, bars are shown to represent experience in languages and methodologies, because experience in media is often depicted as bars. So, it would be best to continue the semantic association.   
- **Hover Effects**: Shown in `style.css`, Hover effects are used to make the background of the Well white when hovered for easy recognition that the link is being hovered & is click-able.
- **Visited Effects**: Shown in `style.css`, Links will change color once they've been visited. 
- **Mobile "Compatible"**: Shown in `style.css`, the @media(min-width:560px) allows for specific boundaries to be distinguished to display the mobile view and desktop view at certain device size thresholds.
