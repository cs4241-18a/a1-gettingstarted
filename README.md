This project shows my fundamental grasp on HTML, CSS, Git, and Heroku. It contains some basic information about myself such as experience with some tools and courses taken.

## Technical Achievements
- **Applied a stylesheet**: By modifying the `server.js` and `index.html` files I was able to apply a stylesheet that facilitated the design of the website.

### Design Achievements
- **Minimalist Design**: Using CSS (in `main.css`), I am able to design an uncluttered webpage that allows the user to read easily and differentiate between content and headers. Additionally, content is displayed in a mostly vertical format throughout.
