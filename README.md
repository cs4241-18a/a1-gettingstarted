Technical Achievements
According to the basic requirement of this assignment, I modify the index.html to show the information about myself. Specifically, by referencing the W3School and Google, I create the header, the main body part and footer via using various tags in html. I also add CSS to edit and improve the aesthetics of my web page. CSS is also related to design achievements, see the below for more details.

Design Achievements:
The color theme of my web page is dark blue (hex: #23519b) and blue( #709de5). By using the W3School reference, I change the font style including the color and size in my web page in order to make the readers more easily to visualize. Similarly, to make the visualization more comfortable, the background color is also changed to very light cream color. In addition,  I edit the format of the text which greatly enhances the readability. I center most of the text and elements.
