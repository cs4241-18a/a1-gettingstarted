## Technical Achievements
  Was able to load images, css files, and other HTML files.
  This required adding new 'a' tags that would trigger an http request that the
  node js server would handle and redirect to the appropriate page, load the
  correct photo, or load the css file in so the html page would display correctly.

  This also required making a new function is js to handle the css file type
  differently because the other sendFile() function had the wrong context type
  for css files.

  Used properties of css to make certain things on my site display differently depending on the tags surrounding them. For example, the <li> tag would display different when it was surrounded by a <nav> tag that a <project tag>.

### Design Achievements
  Made a navigation bar so that users of the site could find what they were looking for quicker. It was also a nice way of organizing the information on the site.

  Used a color scheme generator to create the color scheme hierarchy for my website with colors that would complement each other well.

  Also, did some research into fonts and found a couple of fonts (Dosis & Open Sans) that complemented each other well and would be legible for their purpose. Meaning Dosis would look good and would be very readable as a big h1 font. And Open sans would look nice and also be legible as the standard text font.

  Did some cool things with css to make the blockquote on the About Me page look fancy.
