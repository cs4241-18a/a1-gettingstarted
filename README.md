This project shows the ability to modify the html of the index.html file and deploy a web app on heroku.

## Technical Achievements
In this project, my technical achievement is linking css and js to my index.html. I have changed the basic font family of the entire page using a css style sheet, and I have included an automatically updating ethereum price ticker using javascript. I have also used ajax to query an external api in order to get the ethereum price, and a success call back to update the html asynchronously.

### Design Achievements
I have changed the font of the page to a more appealing style, and have ordered my information using list elements in order to make them more appealing to look at.
