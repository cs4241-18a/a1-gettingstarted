This project shows that I have a working knowledge of Git, Github, and Heroku. We had to edit an html file and deplot it on heroku so that we can access it through the web.

## Technical Achievements
- **Depolyed Page on Heroku**: Created an app on Heroku using Heroku command line interface and used git push to deploy local project onto the Heroku app.
- **Edited HTML file**:
- **Edited Server Code**: The server code was edited in order to provide access to the new images and CSS stylesheets created for this assignment. All I had to do was add the new paths as new cases to the switch statement that located the path of the requested files in server.js.

### Design Achievements
- **Used HTML tags to uniquely identify different sections, create lists and add images or links**: <div>,<p>,<img>,<a>,<li> Are some of the many tags used in the webpage
- **Use of CSS stylesheet to improve the look and responsiveness of the website**: Made page size and design dynamically responsive to the size of browser/window accessing it. Added a custom font using Google's font API.
- **File organization in backend**: Separated images and css files into separate directories for organization
- **Use of nested unordered lists**: Shown in `index.html`, at the work experience section to categorize work experience
