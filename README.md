This project shows my ability to set up a basic client server web application using HTML, CSS, and JS.
The website is hosted by Heroku.

I also showed my React skills just a little bit by writing my experience section in JS using the React Library.
More information on React can be found here: https://reactjs.org/

Most of my CSS uses flexbox, which makes it extremely easy to center and scale elements in the webpage.

The web page itself is a basic portfolio of my career at WPI. It shows the CS classes that I have taken, and my experience with a list of technologies. This web app can be found at the following URL: https://a1-qaverill.herokuapp.com/


## Technical Achievements
- **External CSS**: Using a file dedicated to CSS, I imported this file to the index.html page and modified the server to send the CSS file when requested.
- **React JS Library**: I imported the React JS library to my project, and altered the server to send the react.js file to the client when requested. I used React because I am very familiar with it, and I like being able to manipulate memory so easily. Also, I really like JSX.


### Design Achievements
- **My touch of CSS**: I made the theme 'electric' and simple using two css sheets: elements.css and flexbox.css. I incorporated flexbox because I feel that it is most easy to work with, and causes the least amount of headaches possible.
