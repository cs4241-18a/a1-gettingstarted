This project shows an basic web page about me. 

## Technical Achievements
- Learned about bootstrap and their grid system. And how it responds to windows size. 
	- I originally had my page mimick pinterest. I tried using the cards offered by bootstrap. Didn't end up using it because I didn't like how it looked. 
- I learned about serving static css pages and images.
- I learned about tiling an image to fill a background. That way I don't have to stretch an image, or have different sized images. 

### Design Achievements
- I used the New York Times newspapers as a design for my page. 
- I went onto google fonts to change up the fonts so that I don't have the default. 
- Used filters on the images so that it was all uniform with the background.
