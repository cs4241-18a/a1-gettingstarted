## Technical/Design Achievements
- **External CSS**
    I wanted to test using an external CSS file since I've used mostly inline CSS in previous projects. I wanted to try using one of hte other kinds of CSS,
    and though this is a small part of the site it helped me to understand how set things up for external files in the html code and in the server code.
- **Processing Sketches**:
    Recently I've been interested in the gif art of Bees and Bombs (https://twitter.com/beesandbombs); I really like how abstract, minimal and satisfying the art they make is,
    and I knew it was created using code. For this assignment I decided to dive in and explore this form of art since it is closely tied to the Web. Since they post some of their
    source code I found out they do their art using Processing, a visual arts language. I used processing to make two sketches. The left one was adapted from one of the example
    sketches (https://processing.org/examples/array2d.html), and I turned it into an animated sketch that works by itself. For the right one I wanted to make something that was
    interactable, so the cubes rotate based on the mouse position over the sketch.
