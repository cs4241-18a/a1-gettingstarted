This project shows the deployment of a simple website using the Heroku web platform (http://www.heroku.com). It is intended as a chance to get up to speed on Git, GitHub, and Heroku. The website itself is an about page that has information about me.

## Technical Achievements
- **Links**: The course descriptions have been linked to the listed courses under the experience section of the website. What I have learned when adding the links and changing the colors of the link, visited, hover, active states is that the ordering of states in the css matters, as one may override the other. The rules for ordering states is that hover must come after link and visited, and that active must come after hover. There are areas where these states overlap, and that is why the importance of each state matters. The source of this can be found at https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp
- **Classes**: By following a walkthrough on Youtube I was able to create classes for different sections of the HTML. By creating these classes, it is much easier to edit variables in an alternative CSS file, which extracts presentation features from the HTML allowing it to focus on semantics. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNiGz7Zxk2Y

### Design Achievements
- **Color**: Some research on colors has shown that people tend to like a lighter background with darker text to read. Research has also shown that three color palettes have a good reaction. I changed the color to a light blue with a gray/black screen to give a trustworthy/office emotion.

- **Font**: I have looked into some different styles of fonts to use for the website and decided to go with one that was more respectable and traditional.
