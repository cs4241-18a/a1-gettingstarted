## Technical Achievements
- **Implemented a Button**: With the help of W3Schools, I was able to make a button that revealed a video of myself. This required learning how to make a function in html.
- **Used Images and Videos**: I was able to put pictures and a video into my webpage, and then learned how to edit a server to handle these additional components.

### Design Achievements
- **Implemented a CSS File**: After doing some research on StackOverFlow and W3Schools, I was able to make a stylesheet that changed the color and layout of different aspects of my webpage.
