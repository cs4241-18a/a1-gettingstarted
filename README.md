This project shows a basic website that tells a little bit about my background, interests, and experience.

### Design Achievements
Used an external CSS file to better personalize the website. This includes:
Changing the background to a shade of one of my favorite colors with a border color that accents it,
Changing the font size and boldness of the paragraphs and lists,
Centering the main header on the page,
Adding padding to the body and the lists, and
defining the class 'center' for positioning pictures properly.
I also added pictures to go along with the narrative of the website.
