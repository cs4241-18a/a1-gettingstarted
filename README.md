This project shows Html usage that was the result of experimentation and discovery.
I have also created a css to give my web app a unique look. 

## Technical Achievements
Used heading 2 "<h2>" multiple times in my HTML file so my subcategories would be consistent.

### Design Achievements
I made an attempt to use a grey/red color scheme, I thought it looked nice
I also managed to insert an image after 1 hour of difficulties
