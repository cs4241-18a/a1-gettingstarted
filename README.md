## Technical Achievements
- **Link**: Used class notes and websites to help link my LinkedIn account to my website to provide viewers with more information. I implemented a standard href link that when you click "here" it takes you to the connected LinkedIn Page.

- **Form**: I implemented a mini comment form at the bottom of my webapp as I wanted to get comments from people about my website. However I don't have the server script working therefore currently when a used types a comment and clicks submit, it will go to an error page. 

### Design Achievements
- **Bullet Styles**: Reserched online on best ways to list out things such as my classes, and implemented square bullet points in an unorded list as it allows users to easily read and identify the different subjects, rather than having them displayed as: 
CS2012, CS 2303, CS2022 ... and so on.
