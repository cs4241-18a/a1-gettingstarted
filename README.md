This project shows the information about me.

## Technical Achievements
- **Taught myself html&css**:
I had almost zero experience in HTML and CSS before. I modified the font and alignment.
- **Usage of <div>**:
I used <div> to make 3 main different sections of this website.
- **Usage of <ul>**:
The left section contains the CS courses I have taken at WPI. I used <ul> to make a list to clearly show the courses.
The right section contains my experience with various programming languages. I used <ul> to make a list to clearly show each of them.
- **Usage of <img>**:
The middle section contains basic information about me. I used <img> to insert my favorite meme into this section.
- **css**:
I used <link> and <style> for the CSS part. I had to add a few lines in server.js to make the external CSS file work.

### Design Achievements
- **Color Combination**:
I used three colors: green, blue, and purple as the theme of this website. They are calm, tranquil, elegant colors, and also my favorite colors. I used lighter colors as the background colors, and darker colors as the font color. There is a smooth gradient between these three colors on the background.
- **Font Selection**:
I chose helvetica. I have several Apple devices, and I really like this font.
