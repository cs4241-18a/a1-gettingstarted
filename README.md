This project demonstrates that students understand the fundamental concepts and opperations used in html coding.This project also proves that students were able to get set up with github, heroku and other tools needed for future projects.

### Design Achievements
- **Centered elements of website [main header, main description, additional description, photos, experience with technology and methods and experience header]**: Shown in index.htlm
- **Right aligned elements of website [experience description, related courses header and list of courses]**: Shown in index.htlm
- **Varied alignment [alignment of all text below photos has specified margins so text doesn't expand too far and appear awkward]**: Shown in index.htlm
- **Changed element fonts [headers are different fonts than descriptions]**: Shown in index.htlm
- **Added photos [photos of past digital artwork]**: Shown in index.htlm and server.js
- **Created a link to another website [the words Jackpine Technology are a link to the company's website]**: Shown in index.htlm
- **Created a list of related classes**: Shown in index.htlm
- **Changed color of background**: Shown in index.htlm
- **Changed color of Large Text to Purple**: Shown in index.htlm
- **Added additional classes [Made classes for headers 1 and 2 to decrease the spacing between headers and their related descriptions]**: Shown in index.htlm

All these design chosen were a way for me to experiment with and implement some of the basic featured html has to offer.
