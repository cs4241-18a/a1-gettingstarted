## Technical Achievements
- **Single Page Web App**: The tabs navigate to seperate subpanes instead of individual .html pages. This is more lightweight and allows for quicker navigation through the site. This is more effective and a better overall design than trying to manage multiple pages.
- **Edited Server.js**: Edited the server .js file to allow successful hosting and fetching of images and a seperate css style sheet. This was accomplished by moving the main webpage elements to the 'public' folder and then updating the server file to fetch these from the appropriate location on the Heroku server.

### Design Achievements
- **Navigation Tabs**: The tabs on the banner allow for quick navigation to seperate elements of the project. 
- **Web Application Experience Table**: The table showing my web application experience uses a bootstrap library that marks rows based on my answer in the right column. Using the classes "danger" and "success" the table displays green and red for Yes and No respectively.
