This project shows my ability to create a webpage using HTML and CSS, as well as my ability to follow instructions on deploying it as an application on heroku.

## Technical Achievements
- **Edited server.js**: Shown in 'server.js'.  Using examples from class, as well as from the Slack, I was able to serve CSS and Images using a switch statement in the sendFile method.
- **External CSS Stylesheet**: Shown in 'index.html' and 'styles.css'.  I was able to move my internal stylesheet to its own file, called 'styles.css', and linked that file in the header of 'index.html'.

### Design Achievements
- **CSS Stylesheet**: Shown in 'style.css'.  I designed different styles for various headings, and other tags.  I also created classes in order to assist in styling.  Coloring and fonts were chosen with readability and contrast in mind.
- **Image Links**: Shown in 'index.html'.  I did a Google Search for noncommerical reuse images of three social media platform logos, and made them all the same size, placing them in a row.  I then made them clickable links that would redirect a user to my social media profiles on these platforms.
- **Two Lists Side-by-Side**: Shown in 'index.html'.  I spent a long time trying to figure out the best way to display my experience side by side.  Using styles, specifically float, I was able to finally create the look I was going for here.
- **Overall Layout and Design**:  Shown in 'index.html' and 'styles.css'.  I wanted my website to fit my computer screen with no scrolling necessary.  I achieved this desired look, contributing to the overall layout of my website.  I took insirpation from Professor Harrison's website, limiting the maximum width, and making the content of the webpage more concise, as well as the placement of my profile picture.  Thanks Professor :)
