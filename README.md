## Technical Achievements
- **Adding background img**: updated javascript file to include a background image 
- **Adding a shadow and a link**: when you scroll over h3 headers such as "Work Experience", it will create a shadow affect. I also added a link to my github. 

### Design Achievements
- **Created new div in order to center text and make it readable**: As can be seen under the style tag, I added a div to center the text. I gave the div both the margin and padding values. Additionally, I changed the background of the div to make the text more readable. I decided to keep the text black, so I simply made the background white and changed the opacity. That way, the background is faded but still visible.
