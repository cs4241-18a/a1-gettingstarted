This project shows information about myself to my professor and classmates.

## Technical Achievements
- **Added Google charts to the webpage: 

At first, I created a HTML table to list my skills/experience, but later found that Google Charts can also be implemented into HTML with more graphical options.
(I only chose to create a table because that better displays my skills in each of the categories).
Therefore, I attempted to give Google Charts a try. This was a good exercise for me to understand and practice Javascript more. 

### Design Achievements
- **CSS styles: 

This is my first time working with CSS, but I experimented with the different functionalities (such as colors, images, and links) to match my WPI theme.
