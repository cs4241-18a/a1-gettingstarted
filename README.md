This project shows that I can deploy a webapp to Heroku while also making use of Git/Github.
Additionally, this project also shows that I have learned some basic html and css through my edits
to the initial index.html page as well as the creation of a styles.css file. 

### Design Achievements
- centered text and other elements on the page (These edits can be found in styles.css)
- created table to show coding language familiarity on page (Can be seen in index.html)
- created list to show relevant courses taken (can be seen in index.html)
- added image [labled for reuse] to website (can be seen in index.html)
- changed background color of website (can be seen in styles.html)
