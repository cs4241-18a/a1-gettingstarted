## Technical Achievements
- **Implemented CSS animation**: The first question in my quiz section uses a typewriter effect using a simple keyframe rule. 
- **Responses to quiz are aligned left and right on the same line**: Done with a very common HTML trick where one floats the respective responses left and right in CSS instead of aligning them (which will split them up).
- **Split the HTML, CSS, and JS into their own documents**: Massively improving readability by simply adding more `includefile()` cases to `server.js`. 
- **Enable dynamic display of quiz elemetns with JS**: Use of the CSS `display` property and `onclick` JS listeners.

### Design Achievements
- **Successfully imitated the style of a blog I like**: The minimalist style of my page is modeled after one of my [favorite tech blogs](http://matt.might.net/).
- **Used a consistent font scheme throughout page with Googlefonts**: Used the Google font API and appropriate HTML tags to maximize readability and clarity of text.
- **Used a proven visually pleasing color scheme**: Neutral gray of background + the header colors form the known [peppercorn hue combination](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/45528646205244991/).
