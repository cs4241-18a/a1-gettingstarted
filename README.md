## Technical Achievements
- This was my first time ever using CSS so I wanted to play around a bit. Firstly, I modified the server so that it
 could send out a css file when called upon. Then I set up some basic styles for fonts and colors. I made some cool
 interactive triangles because it interested me. I wanted to make more but we havn't gotten to java script yet so I thought
 I would wait.

### Design Achievements
- I think I have the start of an aethetically pleasing website. I did't look into any design theory or anything but im 
sure it looks better than some other people. 


Listen, as long as I can tell my mom that I got a 100 I'll be happy (don't tell her its out of 120)
