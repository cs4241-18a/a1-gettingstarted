This project shows a basic understanding of git, heroku, and html. There was additional css and javascript knowledge
demonstrated, indicating a slightly higher understanding of the two. I was able to apply css knowledge that I already had,
as well as learning some new javascript by using jquery. In terms of content it has some information about me.

## Technical Achievements
- server.js: modified the server.js file to allow the use of css and javascript files
- jquery: I have little experience with jquery so I wanted apply it in a basic way to this project. I did this
through '.hover()' on the technology experience section as well as with 'show more', and 'show less' in the classes section.

## Design Achievments
- color: I used green, red and yellow to indicate my levels of understanding for the technologies. These colors represent
levels to humans, green: go etc. and can be applied to the tech section.
