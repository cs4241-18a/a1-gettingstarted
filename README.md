There isn't really anything for technical or design achievements here,
but I attempted to write something

This project shows ...

## Technical Achievements
- **Used HTML Lists**: I listed my cs classes and my experience in list format

### Design Achievements
- **Used lists instead of line breaks**: Lists are clearly designed to show a "list" of values, so they seemed a more appropriate choice than manually using line breaks in the p tag
