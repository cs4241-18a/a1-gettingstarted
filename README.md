This project contains my main interests and the personal projects I have developed in the different fields. Additionally, it includes information on my previous courses and experiences relevant to this course. To accomplish the project I used a combination of HTML and CSS. The project includes stylesheets that I wrote as well as BootStrap stylesheets. The main goals of this project were to achieve multiple Design Achievements and one specific Technical Achievement. These will be described in detail in the following sections.

## Technical Achievements
***
- Used **Bootstrap**: included an external stylesheet but also incorporated my own ideas by keeping in mind the cascading rule and including my stylesheet after the BootStrap one. This allowed me to change things such as the size of the tables, the background colors, the font and the position of the table within the screen. 
- Used **`em` and `%`** rather than `px` for the sizing of things on the page. This allowed me to create a fully responsive website.
- Things to **improve**: 
    - Repetition of code to make sure the information was properly aligned in the tables could be avoided by using something like classes in React.
    - The amounf of files in the project made it slightly slow to load after deploying it on Heroku. This could be improved in future projects. 

### Design Achievements
***
- Used the combination of 2 **fonts**:
    - Nixie One
    - Libre Baskerville
- Explored many different combinations of **colors**. Making a final decision was not easy considering the mixture of dark and light colors of the background. My goal was for this introductory website to show a part of me. Although the final colors were not my favorite, I did want to keep a galactic theme since I can easily identify with the outdoors and contemplating the stars. Finally, I was able to reach this color palette for the entirety of the page. 
    - `#baaa55`
    - `#253b35`
    - `#89b686`
    - `#000000`
    - `#ffffff`
- Used a more **minimalist** and visual way of communicating
    - Use of only **lowercase letters**:

        - As I said before, my goal was for the page to show parts of my personality. I thought that keeping lowercase letters gave the page mostly casual vibes, which is something that I deliver in person.
        - 'Friendlier' than capitalizing every word
        - Consistency is important in a website. For this reason I never never used capitalized letters.
    - Used **Bootstrap** tables to convey a direct message rather than full sentences to share the information
- Made sure to keep the **theme** of the website as galatic/starry night:
    - **Parallax scrolling** achieved the sense of the theme by creating a floating sensation of the content of the page on the background images
    - **Dark BootStrap tables** contributed to the color scheme and theme of the website
