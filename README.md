This project shows a basic HTML page with information about me. 

## Technical Achievements
- I created a navigation bar which allows the user to navigate the HTML page with ease. To find a setion on the website, they can easily select from the navigation bar and they are directed to that section on the page. This aids with the user interface intended to help webpage visitors access information.

### Design Achievements
- I did research to find a font that would work well for an About Me page. I decided upon the font GT Walsheim because it is a geometric sans serif font that works well in both headlines and body fonts. It is a fun font that helps a personal portfolio's styling and is very user friendly. 
- I chose this background color because according to my research, bright colors are distracting so colors that can fade into the background and bring forward your work are the best. Neutral color schemes are the cleanest and most effective backdrops.
