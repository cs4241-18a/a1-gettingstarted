This project shows how to use Heroku for website hosting, and how Heroku uses Node.JS and npm to function.

Technical Achievements
    I added multiple html, css, and img files to my site. This required me to modify the switch statement in the
    server.js file along with making a separate function to read css files.

Design Achievements
    I added the feature so that when you hover over a link, the mouse cursor turns into a pointer finger. This allows
    the user to receive confirmation that this link is clickable.
    I added a menu at the top of the page under each page's heading. This was a design feature to categorize my personal
    info and make the site easier to navigate. I centered the paragraph text on each page along with centering the
    lists. I removed the bullets from these lists as I felt this looked better. I added the profile picture from my
    github account as an image on the front page of my site.
