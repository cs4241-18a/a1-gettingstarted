This project shows a mobile-first, simple business-card-like personal website. The site is single page, but functionally
provides two pages - one with an image of myself and a bit of basic information, the other with more detailed experience information.

### Technical Achievements
- **Javascript Content Switching**: The contents of one page are dynamically hidden as the other is revealed using Javascript. An animation makes the switch smooth and showey for the audience. 

### Design Achievements
- **Mobile-first Responsive Design and Style**: Materialize CSS was utilized to allow the page to both look clean and respond well to changes in screen size.
- **Creative Page Arrangement**: Rather than having only one page, a single page is served, but content is divided, providing the initial aesthetic of a business card.
