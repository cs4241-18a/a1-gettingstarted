This project shows my ability to create and deploy a web application using heroku. It also demonstrates my ability to grasp the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as some minimal node.js
This project also showcases some of my personality to the best of my current techincal ability ;)

## Technical Achievements
- **Used images**: Shown in index.html and server.js. For the first project, since it was not required, I added 2 images to my page. I added case statements in server.js and added the images in the html file.
- **Used external CSS stylesheet**: Shown in styles.css and index.html. I linked a stylesheet in the header of my html file.
- **Used a font from an external font service**: shown in index.html. I linked the Google fonts source in my header and used a font from there for my title. 

### Design Achievements
- **Chose Font carefully**: I researched what fonts tend to go easier on the eyes and I came up with Verdana, so I used that for 99% of the text on my page.
- **Used unique font for title**: I decided to use a Google font for my title to set it apart from the rest of my text.
