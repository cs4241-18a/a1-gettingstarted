This project shows a basic understanding of html, css and javascript. The project was deployed to the web via a nodeJS server on Heroku.

## Technical Achievements
- **Serving CSS/Javascript**: The server was modified to serve css and javascript linked to html.

### Design Achievements
- **Conservation of space, ease of use**: Profile sections start as collapsed, can be expanded by hovering, and held open by clicking the section name. This minimizes unnecessary info while allowing the user to display as much as desired.
