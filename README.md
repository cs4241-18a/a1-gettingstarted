Assignment 1 - Hello World: Basic Deployment w/ Git, GitHub, Heroku  
===

This assignment is a "warm-up" exercise. 
You will simply deploy the starting Web site that you will use this term to the [Heroku Web platform](http://www.heroku.com/). 

Refer to [Getting started with node.js on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction).

(Thanks to past instructors of the course, here is a short [getting started with Heroku movie](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gpollice/Movies/HerokuGettingStarted/) that may also help.)

Treat this assignment as a chance to get up to speed on Git, GitHub, and Heroku. 
If you already know these, great. 
However, if you're new to them, spend several hours practicing, experimenting, and reading documentation. 
In other words, don't just get your website up and done. You will need skill with these tools throughout the rest of the course.

Assignment details
---

Do the following to complete this assignment:

1. Fork the starting project code. This repo contains:
    * the server code, `server.js`
    * the `Procfile` that you need for Heroku deployment
    * A starting `index.html` file that you will edit as described below
2. Edit `index.html` to show the following information about you:
    * your name and class at WPI (e.g. class of 2020) Note: Do not put any contact or personal information that you do not potentially want other people outside of this class to see.
    * your major(s) and minor(s)
    * previous computer science courses that you have taken at WPI
    * your experience with the following technologies and methods (none, some, a lot)
        * HTML
        * CSS
        * Java
        * JavaScript
        * Ruby
        * Python
        * unit testing
3. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page, it displays correctly.
4. Deploy your project to Heroku.
5. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme (guide follows) so we can find it.
6. Modify the Readme to the specification below.
7. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo.

Naming and URL Scheme
---

You must use a consistent naming scheme for all projects in this course.
If we can't find it, we can't grade it.

By default Heroku assigns your application a random name.
To change it, follow [this guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/renaming-apps).

The name scheme should be `a1-yourGitHubUsername`.
The `a1` will need to be updated to `a2`, `a3`, and so on in future projects.

This project shows an interest in a minimalistic design while retaining the ability to present information with clarity and efficiency. When designing this website, I had several ideas on how to format the content, as there wasn't a great deal of information required to be submitted, so I was brainstorming of interesting ways on presenting them. During this time my mind was brought back to the installation sequence of Windows 10- how once the core files are installed, relevant text just fades in and out informing the user as to what's going on. This design philosophy felt "clean" to me and I wanted to retain that feeling of smoothness in my project. So, I decided upon having each section/subsection of the page fade in order- this allows viewers to focus on each element as they're loaded in, and fine-tuning the delay and animation duration to ensure that it did not feel laggy- having the introduction be "snappy" every time was my goal. I will discuss this more in the technical achievements. I saw Prof. Harrison's website at WPI and really enjoyed the minimal design he emphasized, where it's not bland yet just feels "cool" to read. My ultimate goal of this website was to integrate a few interesting CSS animation concepts while not going over-the-top with a color scheme and overall design, allowing users to view the
information at their own pace and leisure.
