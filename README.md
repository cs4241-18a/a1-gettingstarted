This project shows a personal introductory page that goes over my passions/interests as well as my technical background. Overall, the page is meant to give the reader a basic sense of who I am.

## Technical Achievements
- **Incorporated Image Files **: Used images in the page to help convey who I am through providing a picture of myself and a background image I took myself while on vacation in Maine, a favorite place of mine to visit. In doing so, I also had to edit the server.js file to call upon the two image files when needed.

- **Added CSS **: While this also relates to design, I thought I would include CSS as a technical element as well since this project is supposed to be our first exposure to html and CSS. I wrote some CSS to format the page to make it more than just black and white text through stylizing the text and adding assets such as a transparent box over the background to make it look more professional.


### Design Achievements
- **CSS Design**: I made sure to add a good amount of CSS to the project to try to make it more professional and have it stand out more than just a plain white page. I edited the structure of the page to fit my picture alongside the text and edited the text to make it stand out more. I also added a background image of a personal favorite location that helps not only spice up the page but also add on to the message Iâ€™m trying to convey.
