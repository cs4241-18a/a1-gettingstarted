## Technical Achievements
added an image of myself to the webpage and updated on "server.js"

added "style.css" and updated on "server.js"

### Design Achievements
-
used a blue color pallette to section off three boxes of Information in a uniform way, the boxes are colored from darkest to lightest to guide the eye down the page as the user reads - shown in "style.css"

spaced out the blocks by adding padding and margins to provide white space between blocks to make for better readability and set the width of each box to 100% to fill the entire space of the viewport - shown in "style.css"

 changed the font of the title to be white to stand out against dark blue background and centered font - shown in "style.css"

the text in the first two boxes were written in a way to make them appear longer across the screen while the text in the bottom box was arranged in a list format to draw the eye down. The overall structure of the text is in an "F" pattern which is an appealing visual hierarchy to the reader as their eye is initially drawn left to right then down the page.
